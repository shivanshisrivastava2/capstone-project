# 🚗 Real-Time Urban Parking Pricing Engine

A smart, real-time pricing system for 14 urban parking spaces built using **Pathway**, **Pandas**, and **Bokeh**. It dynamically adjusts parking fees based on demand, traffic, and real-world conditions — improving utilization and reducing congestion.

---

## 📌 Overview

In cities, fixed parking prices cause inefficiencies — either **overcrowding** or **underutilization**. This project introduces two models for **dynamic pricing**:

* **Model 1**: Linear pricing based on current occupancy.
* **Model 2**: Demand-based pricing using multiple real-time signals.

The system ingests **live data streams**, processes pricing decisions **on the fly**, and visualizes pricing changes **in real time**.

## 🧮 Model Details

### ✅ Model 1: Baseline Linear Model

**Logic:**

```python
price = base_price + α × (occupancy / capacity)
```

* Increases linearly as occupancy rises.
* Resets every 30-min tumbling window.
* Simple and interpretable.

📊 **Visualized** using Bokeh's streaming plot.

### ✅ Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

**Logic:**

```python
norm_demand = (
    occupancy / capacity
    + 0.3 × queue_length
    - 0.2 × traffic
    + 0.4 × is_special_day
    + 0.3 × vehicle_type_weight
)
price = base_price × clip(norm_demand, 0, 2)
```

* Multi-signal demand estimator.
* Pricing reflects real-world features:

  * Holiday traffic
  * Truck vs. car vs. bike
  * Real-time congestion
* Smoother and more fair than static pricing.

📊 **Streamed Plot** updates every second with new prices per lot.
